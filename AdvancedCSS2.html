              Illinois State University takes great pride in shared governance. The University recognizes that for the institution to operate effectively the voices of administrators, faculty, staff, and students need to be heard and that optimal solutions often come from the results of these groups collaborating. University governing bodies – Board of Trustees, Academic Senate, Administrative/Professional Council, Civil Service Council, and Student Government Association—represent the constituencies of the University and form the formal structure for shared governance.
            </P>

            <p class="p2">
              The governance of Illinois State University is vested by law in the Board of Trustees. Within the limits set by the State Constitution and the federal and state laws, the Board of Trustees is the final authority in all matters affecting the institution, and it exercises jurisdiction over the institution's financial, educational, and other policies and its relation with the state and federal governments.
