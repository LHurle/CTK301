			<h2>Full Biography</h2>

			<p class="bioparagraph">
				Hello! My name is Laura Hurley, and I am pursuing Creative Technologies major at Illinois State University (ISU) in Bloomington, IL.
				I am an aspiring concept artist and character design artist. I have always been interested in working behind-the-scenes in media.

			<p class="bioparagraph">
				I have been interested in art since early childhood, when I picked up a pencil at the tender age of four years old! I haven't put it down since, and have been engaging in art my entire life.
				I am an alum of Lincoln Community High School, located in Lincoln, Illinois. While I was there, I only took one art class. However, once I graduated and attened Lincoln College, I was lucky enough to be able to pursue an Associate's degree in Art.
			</p>

			<p class="bioparagraph">
				My main medium is pencil, ink pens on paper, and Artist's Loft markers. But recently, I have experimented with other mediums such as charcoal and pastels.
